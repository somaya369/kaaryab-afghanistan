# 💼 KaarYab Afghanistan

A modern opportunity discovery platform built with **Next.js** to help Afghan youth find jobs, internships, scholarships, remote work, training programs, volunteer opportunities, and online courses in one place.

---

## 📝 About the Project
KaarYab Afghanistan is a modern web application developed as part of a university coursework assignment to demonstrate practical skills in modern frontend web development.

The project addresses a common challenge faced by Afghan youth: opportunities are often scattered across different websites, social media pages, and organizations. KaarYab Afghanistan brings these opportunities together into a single platform where users can easily search, filter, save, and manage them through an intuitive and responsive interface.

Beyond solving this problem, the project showcases the implementation of modern React and Next.js development practices, reusable component architecture, responsive UI design, state management, animations, and API integration.
